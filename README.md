To include one (or more) package(s) in your workspace, clone the repository and copy the desired pakage(s) (supposing that you have created an empty workspace following ROS2 conventions, they should be copied under ```<workspace_folder>/src```).
Move into your workspace folder and build with ```colcon```:
```
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select <package_name> [<other_package> ...]
```
Then open another terminal and ```source``` the install script generated by the build (different scripts are generated for different command line interpreters):

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```
